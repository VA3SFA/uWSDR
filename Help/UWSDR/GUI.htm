<p>This is the main screen of the UWSDR GUI. It has been modelled on a standard transceiver, the Icom IC-706 in this case, and then expanded to better fit operator requirements. Like the IC-706 many of the lesser used functions have been hidden in menus accessed from the <a href="Menu.htm">Menu</a> button, but the main controls are easily available on the front panel.</p>
<p>For each mode it is possible to specify what the <a href="ModePref.htm">default filter bandwidth and step sizes</a> are, so that a degree of customisation is possible. This filter bandwidth is easily overridden from the front panel.</p>
<p><a href="Tuning.htm">Tuning</a> may be done via the main tuning knob using the mouse buttons at three different speeds, or via the mouse wheel (where applicable), or by directly typing the frequency via the <a href="FreqKeypad.htm">Frequency Keypad</a>.</p>
<p>The title bar of the window includes the version number of the software, the SDR name, and if the SDR is receive only.</p>
<p>A built in <a href="CWKeyboard.htm">CW Keyboard</a> allows for simple CW operation.</p>
