<p>The Meter serves two purposes. On receive it displays the signal strength, and on transmit it displays the relative output power. The meter can be set to measure the values at various stages in both the transmit and receive chains by use of the <a href="SMTransmit.htm">Transmit</a> and <a href="SMReceive.htm">Receive</a> menues which are available by clicking the right hand mouse button when over the meter.</p>
<p>The transmit menu is not available when the SDR is receive only.</p>
