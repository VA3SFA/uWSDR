<p>The Type of the Spectrum Display can be changed by accessing the Type Menu from the Spectrum Display menu. There are four types of display, Panadpter, Waterfall, Input Phase, and Audio Scope.</p>
<p>The Panadapter types are just slightly different visual representations of the essentially the same image. It is similar in form to that shown by a spectrum analyser, with frequency being the horizontal axis and amplitude the vertical axis. Each horizontal line represents a number of decibels which is set by the <a href="SDRange.htm">dB Range</a> menu.</p>
<p>The Waterfall type is common amongst software, in it a history of the signal and its amplitude over a length of time. The horizontal axis is frequency, the vertical axis is time, and the amplitude is shown via the different colours used.</p>
<p>The IQ Phase is an attempt to display the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) input signal in a way that allows them to be viewed. They are displayed with time along the horizontal axis and amplitude along the vertical. The I signal is shown in green and the Q in cyan. The signal is scaled to fill the graph.</p>
<p>The Audio display is similar to the IQ Phase above but only shows the output in-phase signal. Unlike the IQ Phase, this signal is not scaled.</p>
