<p>This control sets the level of the output signal that is fed into the SDR hardware and hence the output power, it works regardless of any other settings including the mode. The knob is moved by pressing the left mouse button and dragging the control around, the mark will follow the mouse around.<p>
<p>Each mode has its own setting for the Power and this is remembered by the software.</p>
<p>This control is not operational when the SDR is receive only.</p>
