<p>The Receive Menu allows for the monitoring of the input signal levels at various stages along the receive chain. The taps are at:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>I Input</b> level, is the raw in-phase signal from the hardware.</li>
<li><b>Q Input</b> level, is the raw quadrature signal from the hardware.</li>
<li><b>Strength</b>, is the signal level after filtering, but before the AGC.</li>
<li><b>Avg Strength</b>, is a smoothed version of the Strength above.</li>
</ul>
