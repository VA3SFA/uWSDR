<title>Overview of the UWSDR GUI</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The UWSDR GUI is used to control the SDR hardware and to provide a high performance IF system. It includes all of the features of even the most expensive HF radios. It includes numerous IF filters down to 25 Hz which are guaranteed not to ring under any circumstances, and the possibility to add new modes in the future.</p>
<p>Since most of the "radio" is actually in software, it is easy to update the software from the Internet as new versions become available, see the UWSDR web page at <a href="http://uwsdr.berlios.de">http://uwsdr.berlios.de</a>.</p>
