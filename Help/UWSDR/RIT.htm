<p>RIT (Receiver Incremental Tuning) allows for the receiver frequency to be changed slightly relative to the transmit frequency, this is limited to +/-5 kHz. It is switched on and off by the RIT button and the value is changed via the RIT knob. The frequency change is reflected in the main <a href="FrequencyDisplay.htm">Frequency Display</a> and the status in the <a href="InfoBox.htm">Information Box</a>. The knob is moved by pressing the left mouse button and dragging the control around, the mark will follow the mouse around.</p>
<p>If the SDR is receive only then the RIT button and RIT knob will be grayed out and will not work when pressed.</p>
