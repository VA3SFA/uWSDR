<p>The Mute Button switches off the receive audio, in fact it commands the SDR hardware to stop sending receive data to the PC. This is important as it reduces the amount of bandwidth taken which could be important when many SDRs are on the same network. Transmit is still available when the SDR is muted.</p>
<p>It is only available when the hardware is a UWSDR, otherwise it will be grayed out and will not work when pressed.</p>
