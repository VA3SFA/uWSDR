<p>The Spectrum Display shows a portion of the spectrum around the current operating frequency. The <a href="SDType.htm">Display Type</a>, and its <a href="SDRefresh.htm">Refresh Speed</a>, and the <a href="SDRange.htm">dB Range</a> can be set using a menu accessed by pressing the right hand mouse button over the display. Clicking the left hand mouse button on the display will return the radio to that frequency.</p>
<p>The current receive filter bandwidth and position is shown in the two Panadapeter modes as a grey block.</p>
