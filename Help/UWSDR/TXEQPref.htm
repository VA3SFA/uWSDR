<p>This screen allows for the setting of the transmit audio equaliser. This affects the frequency balance of the transmitted audio and can be used to compensate for the frequency repsonse of microphones in order to make them sound more natural or to add more punch.</p>
<p>The frequencies may be modified in three bands, below 400 Hz, 400 Hz to 1500 Hz, and above 1500 Hz. The overall gain may also be modified using the Preamp setting. The complete transmit audio equalisation may be enabled or disabled on this screen.</p>
<p>These controls are always active and make immediate changes to the equalisation values, even when transmitting.</p>
