<p>The Transmit Button is the primary means of controlling transmit/receive switching, and it operates in parallel with the external transmit/receive switching via the serial port if enabled, as well as in parallel with the <a href="CWKeyboard.htm">CW Keyboard</a> and the <a href="VoiceKeyer.htm">Voice Keyer</a> too.. If the SDR is receive only then the transmit button will be grayed out and will not work when pressed.</p>
