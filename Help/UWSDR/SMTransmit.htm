<p>The Transmit Menu allows for the monitoring of the output signal levels at various stages along the transmit chain. The taps are at:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Microphone</b> level, before any audio processing.</li>
<li><b>Compressed</b> output, after the speech processor.</li>
<li><b>Post ALC</b> level, after the ALC has limited the transmit level.</li>
<li><b>Power</b> output, before the <a href="Power.htm">Power</a> control.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scale of the meter is arbitrary, but unlike the receive meter, the scale on transmit is linear.</p>
<p>This menu is not available if the SDR is receive only.</p>
