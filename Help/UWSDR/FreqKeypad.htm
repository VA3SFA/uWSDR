<p>The Frequency Keypad is what the names suggests, a calculator type entry of frequency, making quick changes of frequency relatively easy. The frequency can be entered in two ways, the complete frequency, or if the text starts with a dot, then only the kilohertz needs to be entered and the current VFO megahertz is used.</p>
