<p>This screen handles the less commonly required settings for the receiver. These are the settings for two different noise blankers, one for impulse noise (Impulse Noise Blanker) and a more general noise blanker (Mean Noise Blanker). Both of these may be enabled with the buttons to the left of the slide controls.</p>
<p>The amount of gain ahead of the IF strip may also be set here. The gain may be set between -30 dB through to 20 dB, with 0 dB representing no gain. This control operates in real-time so its effects can be seen, however only by pressing the OK button will the changed value by stored.</p>
<p>The DSP core of the GUI allows for the use of binaural reception whereby slightly different signals are sent to each ear with stereo headphones. This option may be set here, as well as controlling how the signals are split, using the slider to shift from left to right, or back again.</p>
<p>There is an option to record the received signal of the SDR on the main menu. By default this is the received audio, recorded as a WAV file in 16-bit mono, however it is also possible to save the raw I/Q data from the hardware as a 32-bit stereo signal, with the left channel being the Quadrature and the right the In-phase element. Also it is possible to record the audio as 16-bit stereo which is useful when using binaural reception.</p>
