<p>This screen sets the frequency shifts and frequency offset of the SDR. The receive limits must be the same or within the hardware limits, and the transmit limits must be the same or within the receive limits. These values are in Megahertz.</p>
<p>Shift 1 is used by the <a href="TuningButtons.htm">SHIFT 1</a> button, this is typically used for repeater operation. This value is given in Kilohertz.</p>
<p>Shift 2 is used by the <a href="TuningButtons.htm">SHIFT 2</a> button, this is typically used for repeater operation. This value is given in Kilohertz.</p>
<p>The Offset is a means by which a difference in frequency between the display on the GUI and reality may be removed. This is particularly important when the SDR is not locked to a high quality frequency standard. This value is given in Hertz.</p>
