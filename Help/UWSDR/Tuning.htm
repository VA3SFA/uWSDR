The black mark will follow your mouse around as you move it, releasing the mouse button stops it from following your mouse. The tuning rate may be changed by pressing the right hand mouse button and choosing the multiplication rate from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>The <a href="FreqKeypad.htm">Frequency Keypad</a> can also be used for changing the frequency.</p>
