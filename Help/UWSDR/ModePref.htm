<p>This complex screen sets the defaults for the filter size, tuning rate and AGC/Deviation. The settings for SSB are the values that will be used for both USB and LSB.</p>
<p>The tuning speed references the values set on the <a href="StepPref.htm">Step Size</a> preferences screen. The setting for FM Narrow is taken from the value used for FM Wide.<p>
<p>The filter setting from here is the value used when the Auto setting is set from the <a href="Filter.htm">Filter</a> setting on the main screen, see that help entry for the available values.</p>
<p>The AGC/Deviation sets the deviation value for FM, which can be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 kHz</li>
<li>5 kHz</li>
<li>3 kHz</li>
<li>2.5 kHz</li>
<li>2 kHz</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other modes, the AGC value can be set here. It can be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast</li>
<li>Medium</li>
<li>Slow</li>
<li>None</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no seperate setting for CW Narrow as it takes its AGC value from the CW Wide setting. The Deviation settings are not operational when the SDR is receive only.</p>
