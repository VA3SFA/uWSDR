<p>The UWSDR GUI may be started in a number of ways. Depending on the operating system and the options selected in GUI Setup not all of them may be available to you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clicking on icons created by GUI Setup in either a program menu or from the Desktop.</p></li>
<br />
<li><p>Typing the command in at a command line shell, in the form</p>
<pre>UWSDR &lt;SDR Name&gt;</pre>
</p>where &lt;SDR Name&gt; is the name given in GUI Setup. This option does not work correctly with Mac OS X.</p></li>
<br />
<li><p>Typing the command in at a command line shell, in the form</p>
<pre>UWSDR</pre>
</p>i.e. with no SDR Name argument. In this case the Config Chooser box is shown and a list of existing configurations are given to choose from.</p>

<p>Clicking either the Cancel button or the close window icon will abort the UWSDR GUI.</p>
</li>
