<p>If an external program, such as a data mode program, needs to use the SDR, and if it implements the SDR to external program connection specification then it may be set up here.</p>
<p>The choices for the Name are SDR 1 to SDR 4, with &lt;none&gt; meaning that this feature is disabled. This name must match the name used in the external program.</p>
<p>The Address determines from which source connections are allowed. Local Host means that only connections from programs running on the same computer are allowed, Local Network means that a connection from a computer running on the same LAN are allowed, and Any means that all connections are allowed.</p>
