<title>Overview of GUISetup</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The purpose of GUISetup is to link the definition of the physical SDR with the file containing information about that SDR, and
further information about your PC that it needs to run. This must be done before your SDR may be used. Normally this need only be
done once.</p>
<p>Before using GUISetup, the program SDRSetup must also be run in order to configure any UWSDR hardware that you may have. This is documented elsewhere.</p>
<p>The outcome of running GUISetup is that an instance of your SDR, with a name given by you, will be available to use. The program
will optionally create a desktop icon, depending on the platform, which will allow you to use the SDR by simply clicking
on it.</p>
<p>It is possible to have multiple names associated with one SDR, this may be useful if the SDR is used for drastically different
purposes, such as terrestrial, EME, or satellite use. Each name will be associated with the same hardware but will have separate
defaults, VFO frequencies and other user selected features. Needless to say only one name may be used at once.</p>
