<p>This is the name that the SDR will be known as. In GUISetup it is possible to make changes to an existing name, or to create a
new one. Existing names will appear in the drop down menu, and choosing such a name will cause all of the existing values to be
filled in. It is also possible to enter a new name into the screen. The only rule is that the name must not already exist, and that it cannot contain any white space characters like spaces and tabs..</p>
