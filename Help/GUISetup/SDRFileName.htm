</head>
<body>
<p>Each type of SDR supported by the software has an associated .sdr file that contains information about its hardware capabilities. It is a text file that contains such items as the oscillator step size, upper and lower frequency limits and other important limitations. It is essential that the SDR name is associated with the correct .sdr file.</p>
<p>To help find the required file, the Browse button at the side of the file name entry is available. This pops up a standard file selection window which will help you to find the required file. By default it will point to the standard place where .sdr files are located, this is /usr/share/uwsdr on Linux and C:\Program Files\UWSDR\SDR Files under Windows. Once the correct file is found, then pressing OK will make place that file name into the main GUISetup screen.</p>
