<p>Once all of the items have been entered, it is possble to press the Create button to either create a new SDR name or to
modify an existing one. If GUISetup detects that an existing SDR name exists, it will ask for confirmation that you want to
continue before doing so, modifying an existing SDR name will not lose any existing settings, merely update those entries that
have been changed on the GUISetup screen.</p>
<p>If everything is in order then the data will be written to the appropriate place and a confimation will be displayed. Clocking
OK will dismiss both the confirmation screen and the main GUISetup screen also. If GUISetup has been asked to create a desktop icon,
then this will appear immediately.</p>
