See Build.txt.The internal clocking should now be more efficient as it now uses seperate threads.The UWSDR.desktop file in /usr/share/uwsdr is used as a template for the local .desktop files.Version 0.7.4 - 11 February 2007================================Added SoftRock.txt to explain how to use the GUI with them.Install the text files into /usr/share/uwsdr.Match the dimensions and colours for Mac OS X.Add a set of LSB based CW modes to the mode selection.Fixed frequency offsets for the display on CW.Fixed the LSB based filter bandwidths, they are now the mirror image of the USB ones.Fixed the sound device problems in GUISetup and in the GUI, now ALSA and DirectSound works.Version 0.8 - 8 March 2007==========================Added USB serial devices for Linux in GUISetup.More text in the log file at startup with details of devices opened.The PNG, XPM and ICO images are now semi-transparent, and look better.Changed the rise and fall times of the CW signal.The serial port can be used for controlling an external TX (i.e. SoftRock RXTX).The serial port can be used for an external key and/or external transmit input.Added a second shift so that multiple repeater shifts can easily be accomodated.Open user audio with one channel and double it, this means that GUISetup can see more devices under ALSA.Changes for building on Mac OS X.On Windows, revert to Visual C++ Express.New CW Keyer with a higher and more accurate top speed, as well as real-time text entry.Create optional entries on the Desktop for Linux with GUISetup.A diferent meter is now shown on transmit.If no configuration name is given, an SDR Name chooser popup box will appear.A Makefile for Mac OS X is now included.Version 0.8.1 - 9 April 2007============================Added a UWSDR GUI menu option and removed the option to create menu entries.Added support for Jack on Linux and Mac OS X.Update to wxWidgets 2.8.3.Improved error reporting for the CW and Voice keyers.Added an offset field to the .sdr file for when using converters/transverters.Updated Build.txt to mention where to get the SP1 runtime files for Windows.Re-ordered the modes in the GUI and added USB and LSB data modes.Added new .sdr files for the SoftRock RXTX.Version 0.9 - April 2008========================Convert all communication to and from the UWSDR hardware to UDP.Update to Visual Studio Express 2008.Update to wxWidgets 2.8.7.Update to PortAudio 20071207.Changes to build and operate on Mac OS X better.Removed Visual C++ 6.0 build files.The choice between Hilbert and Weaver methods are now explicit in the Preferences.Added (untested) support for HPSDR.On Windows and Mac OS X, the list of serial ports is taken from the OS. Linux is a fixed list.No longer set the DSP IP address is SDRSetup, this is done dynamically when the GUI first talks to the back-end.Option to record the incoming signal as raw I+Q instead of just the audio.Option to record the audio as stereo also.Display the incoming incoming and outgoing I+Q signals on the scope as well as incoming and outgoing audio.Added (untested) support for the Griffin PowerMate.Changed the refresh on the S Meter and the Spectrum Display to be slower and to save CPU.Option to set binaural audio and the sound position between the left and right channels.Fixed for running on Ubuntu 8.04 LTS with the default libraries (Unicode wxWidgets).Changed the frequency display and information area for better visibility.Version 0.9.1 - November 2013=============================Updated to wxWidgets 2.8.12.Removed the HPSDR support.Support the HackRF hardware, however it is incomplete.Support the DG8SAQ Si570 control protocol.The log now goes to the users home directory.The audio setting in GUISetup are now seperate for input and output.Remove SDRSetup and SDREmulator from the Windows install package.Updated the help files with Windows 8 images.Added a frequency multiplier and I/Q swap parameters to the hardware description file.Removed "Swap I/Q" from the Preferences.Disabled Weaver for Si570 based systems.Change transmit in Demo mode to use the microphone.Change RF attenuator to RF gain and increase range.Show receive filter bandwidth as grey on the panadapter.Frequency picker now works with LSB modes.Allow for a hardware receive gain setting to be set in the .sdr file.Change the colours of the waterfall display.Map the FM Wide mode to FM Narrow on frequencies below 30 MHz.Make the Power control affect the power in the S Meter.Added the Compressed option to the transmit meter.Mic Gain and Power is now on a per mode basis.Frequency display stays the same size.Transmitting frequencies now controlled.Remove the Mic Gain when in CW mode, and make the value fixed.Fixed the CW keyboard for real-time messages.Remove the UWSDR and SoftRock support.Added the new external interface protocol handler.Removed the post AGC receive meter.Added the transmit audio equaliser.Remove the serial input and output ports.
